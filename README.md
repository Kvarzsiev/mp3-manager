## More on the Project

### Motivation
I've decided to work on this for some reasons that started stacking one after the other
  - I want to have my musics organized inside a micro sd card, in a raw format and without any cloud or stuff like that.
  - I want to learn some Rust because, why not?
  - I want to learn to use Git and GitHub.
